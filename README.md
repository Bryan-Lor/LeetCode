Automatically synced via LeetHub, this repository keeps track of all of my LeetCode submissions and solutions.  
  
### My Goals
This is my way of practicing quality code, utilizing data structures, and learning algorithms. With a focus on efficiency and optimization,
I try to find solutions with a time complexity of O(n) or faster. Currently, the concept of space complexity is still new to me
therefore I am not able to evaluate them properly.  

Feel free to look through my solutions!
